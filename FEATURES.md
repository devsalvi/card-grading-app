# Card Grading App - Feature Guide

## Auto-Fill from Card Image Analysis

When you upload a card image and click **"Analyze Card with AI"**, the app automatically fills out the grading form with detected information.

### Fields Auto-Filled by AI Analysis:

1. **Character/Player Name** - Extracted from card text (e.g., Michael Jordan, Charizard, Black Lotus)
2. **Year** - Card year/vintage or set release date
3. **Manufacturer** - Card brand (e.g., Topps, Pokemon Company, Wizards of the Coast)
4. **Card Number** - Set number on the card
5. **Card Type** - Automatically detected: Sports, Trading Card Game (TCG), or Other
6. **Sport/Game** - Basketball, Pokemon, Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc.
7. **Estimated Condition** - Visual assessment (Mint to Poor)
8. **Declared Value** - Automatically set to the estimated average value based on card type

## Card Value Estimation

### How It Works:

The app calculates estimated card values using a multi-factor algorithm:

**Base Value:** $50

**Player Premium:**
- Famous players (Jordan, LeBron, Brady, Mantle, Ruth, Gretzky): **$500 base**
- Other players: $50 base

**Vintage Multipliers:**
- Pre-1970 cards: **3x multiplier**
- 1970-1989 cards: **2x multiplier**
- 1990+ cards: 1x (no multiplier)

**Condition Multipliers:**
- Mint: **2.0x**
- Near Mint: **1.5x**
- Excellent: **1.2x**
- Very Good: **1.0x**
- Good: **0.7x**
- Fair: **0.4x**
- Poor: **0.2x**

**Calculation Examples:**

*Sports Card:*
```
Michael Jordan (famous player): $500 base
1986 (pre-1990): 2x multiplier = $1000
Near Mint condition: 1.5x multiplier = $1500
¬± 20% variance range = $1200 - $1800
Average: $1500
```

*Pokemon Card:*
```
Charizard (popular Pokemon): $300 base
1999 Base Set (vintage): 4x multiplier = $1200
Near Mint condition: 1.5x multiplier = $1800
¬± 20% variance range = $1440 - $2160
Average: $1800
```

*Magic: The Gathering:*
```
Black Lotus (Power 9): $2000 base
Mint condition: 2.0x multiplier = $4000
¬± 20% variance range = $3200 - $4800
Average: $4000
```

### Value Display:

- Shows estimated **range** (min - max)
- Shows **average value** (highlighted)
- Auto-fills the **declared value** field
- Includes disclaimer about estimate accuracy

### When Value Updates:

The estimated value automatically recalculates when you change:
- Player/subject name
- Year
- Manufacturer
- Estimated condition
